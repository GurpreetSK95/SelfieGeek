# SelfieGeek

An application which takes user's photo/video from the camera and stores it in cloud, using Kinvey as a BaaS, and in device storage for offline use. 

No intents to open system camera were allowed for the task, so a new activity had to be configured for taking images and videos. The videos and images are fetched from device location or Kinvey and shown to the user in a grid. 

First task in interview process with SocialCops.
